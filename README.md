# JSON

`JSON` is a JSON parser, written in Terumi. One primary reason for writing this in Terumi is to push the limits of the flimsy compiler, find bugs, patch them, and make the language better.

Supports:

[x] - strings
[x] - numbers
[ ] - negative numbers
[ ] - decimal numbers
[ ] - booleans
[x] - json objects
[ ] - json arrays
